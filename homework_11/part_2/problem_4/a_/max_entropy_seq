/*
Which sequence of N element will generate the maximum entropy? 
How much will be the value of entropy for such a sequence, 
Tell the exact answer? 
*/

/*
We will get the maximum entropy if values in an array are in
decending order.

Example:

arr = {15, 10, 8, 6, 3}

here entropy will be: 4+3+2+1 = 10
it can be calculated as

E(N) = [N * (N-1)] / 2
// 5*4 = 20 / 2 = 10

OR

E(N) = N-1 + E(N-1); for N=1 return 1
// 4+3+2+1 = 10
